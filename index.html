     <h2 class="mecury">Notes on some git actions carried out:</h2><br>

     <h4><strong>1) <u>Basic <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI;</abbr></u></strong></h4>
     <ul>
        <li><b>PWD</b> – use this command for printing your current working directory.</li>
        <li><b>CD</b> – use this command to change or navigate within directories.</li>
        <li><b>LS</b> – use this command to list files and folders in your current directory.</li>
        <li><b>Touch</b> – use this command to create a new file.</li>
        <li><b>Mkdir</b> – use this command to create a new directory.</li>
        <li><b>Rm</b> – use this command to delete a file.</li>
        <li><b>Rm –r</b> – use this command to delete a directory and all its contents.</li>
        <li><b>Cp</b> – use this command to copy a file from one directory to another.</li>
        <li><b>Clear</b> – use this command to clear your terminal.</li>
     </ul>

     <h4><strong>2) <u>Staging and Commits;</u></strong></h4>
     <p>In order to start using Git properly from your terminal, Git needs to be initialized 
        and to achieve that, we use the command “git init” after which one can proceed to other 
        required actions. One of those actions in question is <em>Staging and Committing</em>.</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Staging itself is a step before the commit process in Git. Adding a file to the staging 
            area just simply means letting Git know(track) that those files are ready for 
            commit. To add a file to the staging area, we simply use “git add (filename)” and 
            to see files git is tracking simply use "git status".</li>
        <li>Commits on the other hand are snapshots or milestones of ones projects along the timeline of 
            Git. They are the basic building blocks of a version control system. So to commit 
            a file, we simply use “git commit –m (your message)” and to see all your commits 
            use “git log”.</li>
     </ul>

     <h4><strong>3) <u>Git Branches;</u></strong></h4>
     <p>A branch is a version git repository that diverges from the main working 
        repository, it allows you to move back and forth between different stages of a 
        project. To create and move to a new branch, we use the command “git checkout –b 
        (branch-name)” and to see all existing branches, run the command “git branch”.</p>
     <p>The default branch is usually master or main on most platforms. So if you are 
        comfortable with the changes you made, switch to the default branch, then 
        run command “git merge”.</p>

    <h4><strong>4) <u>Creating and Pushing to a Github Repository;</u></strong></h4>
    <p>In order to have your codes pushed to Github, you need to 
        first create a Github repository on your Github account and then follow the below essential steps:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Generate a new SSH key from your git bash terminal, using the command “ssh-keygen -
                t ed25519 -C your_email@example.com”.</li>
            <li> When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. 
                This accepts the default file location. At the prompt, you can type a secure passphrase, 
                or press Enter for no-passphrase.</li>
            <li>To add the newly generated SSH key to the agent, use the command “eval `ssh-agent -s`” 
                then “sh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa”.</li>
            <li>Copy your key using cat “~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub” and then add this copied key to the 
                SSH and GPG keys settings of your Github account.</li>
            <li>Hopping back to your git bash terminal, connect your repository to your local git by 
                using “git remote add origin (git-repo-link)”.</li>
            <li>Then finally push to Github using “git push origin”.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4><strong>5) <u>Forking and cloning;</u></strong></h4>
    <p>Forking is a Github operation used to clone a repository and its content to 
        your own Github account. This is usually used when you want to make an 
        update to an existing repo e.g. when contributing to open source.</p>
    <p>But cloning on the other hand is a git operation used to clone a repository and its content to your 
        local machine. To carry out this action, we use the command “git clone (repo-name)”.</p>
    <p>Also, to merge changes made to a fork to the main repo, one would need to open a 
        pull request, but with cloning you can push directly to the upstream branch if 
        you have write access.</p>

    <h4><strong>6) <u>Pull Request;</u></strong></h4>
    <p>Speaking of pull requests, these are said to be ways to alert a repo's owner(s) that you want to make 
        some changes to their code. It allows them to review the code first and make sure 
        it looks good before putting your changes on the primary branch.</p>
