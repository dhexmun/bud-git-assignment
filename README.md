# bud-git-tutorial
Blockchain UNN Dev tutorial session on GIT/GITHUB

Hey there, this is my first attempt at creating a readme.md file

This project is about a number of Git actions that can be executed on Git/Github and how to successfully carry them out.
As can be seen from the index.html file, I was able to write about six(6) of those action including vital details on how to go about them.

WHAT I LEARNT FROM THIS?

Alot actually but can oly mention a few, starting with the fact that I am now getting myself acquainted with Git/Github and how to navigate around it (unlike before) to my ability to now write and successfully codes thanks to the youtube sessions from BlockchainUNN Developers Community.
I can't fail to mention as well that the session has taught me basic tools and requirements needed to kickstart a dev journey, something I look forward to.
